Module 1 Likert Scale

I am missing question 7 on the questionnaire but there is data. What is the question for m1_2_7	pre-test, module 1, Likert question #7 


The research question is whether the group have improvements in the dependent variable from pre to post test.

But most of the time in Pre-Post studies, the interest is in the change from pre to post across groups.


The ANCOVA approach answers a different research question: whether the post-test means, adjusted for pre-test scores, differ between the two groups.

Time2 of the variable of interest as the outcome and time 1, covariates and group as predictors

 difference in mean post-treatment scores
